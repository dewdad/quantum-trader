# Technical Analysis Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the technical analysis tools implemented in the trading bot. It covers the workings, mathematical formulas, and configuration guidelines for each tool.

## Technical Analysis Tools

### 1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)

**Description**: The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a widely used technical indicator that calculates the average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that range.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{SMA} = \frac{\sum \text{Price}}{n} \]
where \( n \) is the number of periods.

**Configuration**:
- `period`: Number of periods for SMA calculation.

### 2. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

**Description**: The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{EMA} = \text{Price}_{\text{today}} \times \left( \frac{2}{n+1} \right) + \text{EMA}_{\text{yesterday}} \times \left( 1 - \frac{2}{n+1} \right) \]
where \( n \) is the number of periods.

**Configuration**:
- `period`: Number of periods for EMA calculation.

### 3. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

**Description**: The Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark that gives the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{VWAP} = \frac{\sum (\text{Price} \times \text{Volume})}{\sum \text{Volume}} \]

### 4. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

**Description**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{RSI} = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}} \]

**Configuration**:
- `period`: Number of periods for RSI calculation.

### 5. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

**Description**: The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{MACD Line} = \text{EMA}_{\text{fast}} - \text{EMA}_{\text{slow}} \]
\[ \text{Signal Line} = \text{EMA of MACD Line} \]

**Configuration**:
- `fast_period`: Number of periods for fast EMA.
- `slow_period`: Number of periods for slow EMA.
- `signal_period`: Number of periods for signal line.

### 6. Bollinger Bands

**Description**: Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that consists of a middle band (SMA) and two outer bands (standard deviations above and below the SMA).

**Formula**:
\[ \text{Upper Band} = \text{SMA} + (k \times \text{Standard Deviation}) \]
\[ \text{Lower Band} = \text{SMA} - (k \times \text{Standard Deviation}) \]

**Configuration**:
- `period`: Number of periods for SMA.
- `num_std_dev`: Number of standard deviations for bands.

### 7. Average True Range (ATR)

**Description**: The Average True Range (ATR) is a volatility indicator that measures the degree of price movement for a given period.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{ATR} = \text{Average}(\text{True Range}) \]
where True Range is the greatest of the following:
- Current high minus the current low
- Absolute value of the current high minus the previous close
- Absolute value of the current low minus the previous close

**Configuration**:
- `period`: Number of periods for ATR calculation.

### 8. Average Directional Index (ADX)

**Description**: The Average Directional Index (ADX) is a trend indicator that quantifies the strength of a trend.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{ADX} = \text{Average}(\text{DX}) \]
where DX is calculated as:
\[ \text{DX} = 100 \times \frac{|\text{DI+} - \text{DI-}|}{\text{DI+} + \text{DI-}} \]

**Configuration**:
- `period`: Number of periods for ADX calculation.

### 9. Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

**Description**: The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is a momentum-based oscillator that measures the deviation of the price from its average price.

**Formula**:
\[ \text{CCI} = \frac{\text{Typical Price} - \text{SMA}}{0.015 \times \text{Mean Deviation}} \]
where Typical Price is calculated as:
\[ \text{Typical Price} = \frac{\text{High} + \text{Low} + \text{Close}}{3} \]

**Configuration**:
- `period`: Number of periods for CCI calculation.
