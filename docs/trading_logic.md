# Trading Logic Documentation

## Overview

The trading logic module implements the core decision-making algorithms for the trading system. It combines technical analysis, sentiment analysis, and risk management to generate trading signals and execute orders.

## Components

### 1. Signal Generation

#### Technical Signals
- Combines multiple technical indicators:
  - RSI for overbought/oversold conditions
  - MACD for trend direction
  - Bollinger Bands for volatility
  - Moving averages for trend confirmation
  
```python
def generate_technical_signal(self, market_data):
    """
    Generates a trading signal based on technical analysis
    Returns: float between -1 (strong sell) and 1 (strong buy)
    """
```

#### Sentiment Signals
- Processes sentiment data from:
  - News articles
  - Social media
  - Market sentiment indicators
  
```python
def generate_sentiment_signal(self, sentiment_data):
    """
    Generates a trading signal based on sentiment analysis
    Returns: float between -1 (very negative) and 1 (very positive)
    """
```

#### Combined Signal
- Weighted combination of signals:
  - Technical analysis weight
  - Sentiment analysis weight
  - Historical performance weight
  
```python
def generate_combined_signal(self, technical_signal, sentiment_signal):
    """
    Combines different signals into a final trading signal
    Returns: float between -1 (strong sell) and 1 (strong buy)
    """
```

### 2. Position Sizing

#### Risk Assessment
- Position size calculation based on:
  - Account equity
  - Risk per trade
  - Market volatility
  - Current exposure

```python
def calculate_position_size(self, signal_strength, volatility):
    """
    Determines appropriate position size based on risk parameters
    Returns: int (number of shares to trade)
    """
```

#### Risk Limits
- Maximum position size
- Maximum account exposure
- Maximum loss per trade
- Sector exposure limits

### 3. Order Management

#### Entry Rules
- Signal strength thresholds
- Market condition filters
- Time-of-day restrictions
- Liquidity requirements

```python
def validate_entry(self, symbol, signal, market_conditions):
    """
    Validates if an entry order should be placed
    Returns: bool
    """
```

#### Exit Rules
- Take profit levels
- Stop loss levels
- Time-based exits
- Signal reversal exits

```python
def validate_exit(self, position, market_conditions):
    """
    Validates if an exit order should be placed
    Returns: bool
    """
```

### 4. Risk Management

#### Position Management
- Stop loss placement
- Take profit targets
- Position scaling
- Hedging rules

#### Portfolio Management
- Sector allocation
- Correlation management
- Beta-adjusted exposure
- VaR limits

### 5. Performance Monitoring

#### Trade Analysis
- Win/loss ratio
- Average profit/loss
- Sharpe ratio
- Maximum drawdown

#### Strategy Adjustment
- Parameter optimization
- Weight adjustment
- Risk limit adaptation
- Signal threshold tuning

## Configuration

### Risk Parameters
```yaml
trading_logic:
  risk:
    max_position_size: 1000
    max_account_exposure: 0.25
    max_loss_per_trade: 0.02
    stop_loss_atr_multiple: 2.0
```

### Signal Parameters
```yaml
trading_logic:
  signals:
    technical_weight: 0.6
    sentiment_weight: 0.4
    min_signal_strength: 0.3
    confirmation_required: true
```

### Time Filters
```yaml
trading_logic:
  time_filters:
    trading_start: "09:30"
    trading_end: "16:00"
    avoid_first_minutes: 5
    avoid_last_minutes: 5
```

## Integration

The trading logic integrates with:
1. Technical analysis module for indicator values
2. Sentiment analysis module for market sentiment
3. IB Connector for order execution
4. Risk management system for position sizing
5. Dashboard for performance monitoring

## Usage Example

```python
from src.trading.trading_logic import TradingLogic

# Initialize trading logic
logic = TradingLogic(
    config_path="config/trading_logic.yaml",
    risk_manager=risk_manager,
    technical_analyzer=tech_analyzer,
    sentiment_analyzer=sent_analyzer
)

# Process market update
signal = logic.process_market_update(
    symbol="AAPL",
    market_data=market_data,
    sentiment_data=sentiment_data
)

# Generate trading decision
decision = logic.generate_trading_decision(
    symbol="AAPL",
    signal=signal,
    portfolio=current_portfolio
)

# Execute trading decision
if decision.should_trade:
    order = logic.create_order(decision)
    logic.execute_order(order)
```

## Error Handling
