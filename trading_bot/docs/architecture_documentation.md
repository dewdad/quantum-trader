# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The architecture of the trading bot is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable. It consists of several key components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the system. The main components are:

1. **API Connector**: Handles the connection to the Interactive Brokers TWS API.
2. **Technical Analysis**: Performs technical analysis on market data.
3. **Qualitative Analysis**: Integrates qualitative data sources and performs sentiment analysis.
4. **Trading Logic**: Implements the trading strategies and risk management rules.
5. **CLI Interface**: Provides a command-line interface for user interaction.

## Component Details

### 1. API Connector

The `APIConnector` class is responsible for managing the connection to the Interactive Brokers TWS API. It includes features such as automatic reconnection, connection health monitoring, and comprehensive error handling.

- **Automatic Connection Management**: The connector attempts to reconnect automatically with exponential backoff in case of connection failures.
- **Connection Health Monitoring**: Regularly checks the connection status and logs any issues.
- **Rate Limiting Compliance**: Ensures that API requests comply with rate limits to avoid being throttled.
- **Error Handling**: Handles various types of errors, including connection errors and API request errors.

### 2. Technical Analysis

The `TechnicalAnalysis` class provides various technical indicators used for trading decisions. These indicators include:

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**
- **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**
- **Bollinger Bands**

The class is designed to be modular, allowing for easy addition of new indicators.

### 3. Qualitative Analysis

The `QualitativeAnalysis` class integrates data from various qualitative sources such as Google News and Twitter. It performs sentiment analysis on the data to provide a sentiment score that can be used in trading decisions.

- **Data Sources**: Google News API, Twitter API, Company SEC filings, Financial news APIs.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of news articles and tweets.
- **Aggregation**: Aggregates sentiment scores from different sources to provide a comprehensive sentiment score.

### 4. Trading Logic

The `TradingLogic` class implements the core trading strategies and risk management rules. It interacts with the `APIConnector`, `TechnicalAnalysis`, and `QualitativeAnalysis` classes to make informed trading decisions.

- **Order Management**: Handles the placement, modification, and cancellation of orders.
- **Risk Management**: Implements risk management rules such as maximum position size, daily loss limits, and volatility-based position sizing.
- **Trade Execution**: Executes trades based on the combined signals from technical and qualitative analysis.

### 5. CLI Interface

The `CLIInterface` class provides a command-line interface for user interaction. It allows users to monitor the trading bot's performance and make trading decisions in real-time.

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Displays real-time performance metrics and status indicators.
- **Command-line Arguments Parser**: Parses command-line arguments for various trading options.
- **Interactive Mode**: Allows users to interact with the trading bot in real-time.
- **Configuration Management**: Manages configuration settings for the trading bot.

## Data Flow

The data flow in the trading bot is as follows:

1. **Market Data**: The `APIConnector` subscribes to real-time market data and stores it in a data buffer.
2. **Technical Analysis**: The `TechnicalAnalysis` class processes the market data to generate technical signals.
3. **Qualitative Analysis**: The `QualitativeAnalysis` class fetches qualitative data and performs sentiment analysis to generate qualitative signals.
4. **Trading Logic**: The `TradingLogic` class combines the technical and qualitative signals to make trading decisions and manage risk.
5. **Order Execution**: The `APIConnector` places orders based on the trading decisions made by the `TradingLogic` class.
6. **Monitoring**: The `CLIInterface` displays real-time performance metrics and status indicators to the user.

## Error Handling

The trading bot includes comprehensive error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness and reliability. Key error handling features include:

- **Connection Errors**: The `APIConnector` handles connection errors by attempting to reconnect automatically with exponential backoff.
- **API Request Errors**: The `APIConnector` handles API request errors by logging the errors and retrying the requests if necessary.
- **Data Gaps**: The `TechnicalAnalysis` and `QualitativeAnalysis` classes handle data gaps and inconsistencies by using fallback mechanisms and logging the issues.
- **Trade Execution Errors**: The `TradingLogic` class handles trade execution errors by validating orders before placing them and logging any issues.

## Performance Optimization

The trading bot is designed to be high-performance, with a focus on low latency and efficient data processing. Key performance optimization features include:

- **Real-time Data Processing**: The `APIConnector` and `TechnicalAnalysis` classes are optimized for real-time data processing with sub-100ms latency.
- **Efficient Data Storage**: The trading bot uses a time-series database to store historical data efficiently.
- **Modular Design**: The modular design of the trading bot allows for easy optimization and scaling of individual components.

## Security

The trading bot includes several security features to ensure the safety and integrity of the system. Key security features include:

- **Encrypted Credential Storage**: Credentials are stored securely using encryption.
- **Session Token Management**: The `APIConnector` manages session tokens securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- **API Access Logging**: All API access is logged for auditing and monitoring purposes.
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: The `APIConnector` monitors API rate limits to prevent throttling and ensure compliance.

## Conclusion

The architecture of the trading bot is designed to be robust, scalable, and maintainable. By leveraging modular components and comprehensive error handling, the trading bot aims to provide reliable and high-performance trading operations. The integration of technical and qualitative analysis ensures informed trading decisions, while the CLI interface provides a user-friendly way to monitor and interact with the system.
